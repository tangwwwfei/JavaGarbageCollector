# JavaGarbageCollector

The [test script](https://github.com/tangwwwfei/JavaGarbageCollector/blob/master/GCTestScript.sh) for my article An Overview of Java Garbage Collector. 
This script depends on [DaCapo Benchmarks](https://sourceforge.net/projects/dacapobench/files/latest/download).

It also contains the test results, ie those files that end with "gc.log".
